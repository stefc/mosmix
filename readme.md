## Mosmix Reading Library 

With this nuget package you can easy read MOSMIX data came from weather stations around the world. 
So if your service depends on weather data so why not read it out directly from your available weather stations

Have a look in the ```sample``` folder to see how to use it. 

Add a package reference to your ```csproj``` like the following 

````xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="stefc.mosmix" Version="0.2.0" />
</ItemGroup>
````

After this you can create an ```IMosmixReader``` for ```kml``` or ```kmz``` files and read the 
complete weather station document out of it. 

````csharp
using (var stream = File.Open(Path.Combine(path, "MOSMIX_A762.kmz"), FileMode.Open))
{
    var reader = MosmixReaderFactory.CreateForKmz(stream);
    var document = reader.Read(stream);
    System.Console.WriteLine($"Issuer:{document.Definition.Issuer}");
    System.Console.WriteLine($"Name:{document.PlaceMark.Name}");
    System.Console.WriteLine($"Description:{document.PlaceMark.Description}");
}
````

For easy use the lib gives you also a class `ForecastAdapter` that gives you typed access to the raw
timeseries values. The following figures at the moment available [^1] :
